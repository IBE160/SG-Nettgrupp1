# Story Quality Validation Report

**Story:** `2-3-customer-checkout-process`
**Outcome:** PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 0)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

- **[Major] Structure:** Story status is `ready-for-dev`, but the validator expects `drafted`. This is an expected issue due to our accelerated workflow and does not affect the story's content quality.

## Successes

- The story is well-formed with a clear user story, acceptance criteria, and technical tasks.
- All required source documents are correctly cited.
- Continuity check correctly notes that the previous story was not yet implemented.
