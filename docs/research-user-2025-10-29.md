## Executive Summary

**Project:** User Journey Mapping for an online cigar store.

**Persona in Focus:** The "Newcomer" - a potential customer in the Alta region who is new to cigars and seeks a non-intimidating entry point into the hobby.

**Key Insights & Recommendations:**

1.  **Reduce "Choice Overload":** The single biggest barrier for a newcomer is an overwhelming selection. The website's success with this persona hinges on its ability to guide them to a suitable first purchase.
2.  **Guidance is Key:** The "Newcomer" journey should be actively shaped by features that offer guidance and education.
3.  **Bridge the Digital-to-Physical Gap:** The "click-and-collect" model is an opportunity to build a relationship that starts online and is solidified in-store.

**Strategic Recommendations:**

*   **Implement a "Beginner-Friendly" Category/Filter:** Create a curated selection of 2-3 mild, accessible cigars explicitly labeled for new smokers.
*   **Simplify Product Descriptions:** Use simple, relatable language to describe the taste and experience (e.g., "mild and creamy," "a great starting point").
*   **Create a "New to Cigars?" Guide:** A simple page or blog post explaining the basics can build trust and authority.
*   **Enhance the Post-Order Experience:** Use the confirmation email and in-store pickup to provide extra value, such as tips for enjoying their first cigar.
