## Executive Summary

The Alta Sigar & Grill website project aims to develop a comprehensive web application designed to modernize the business's operations and enhance its customer experience. This initiative will provide the business owner with an efficient system for managing product inventory and processing click-and-collect orders, thereby eliminating manual, time-consuming processes. For customers, the platform will offer the convenience of browsing real-time product availability and placing orders remotely for in-store pickup. A key differentiator will be its focus on new cigar enthusiasts, offering a guided and simplified product selection process to overcome the 'choice overload' often experienced on other platforms. By addressing these core challenges, the website will drive operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, expand market reach, and ultimately boost sales for Alta Sigar & Grill.

## Problem Statement

The Alta Sigar & Grill business owner currently operates without any formal order or inventory management system. This absence necessitates manual, time-consuming processes for tracking stock and handling customer requests, leading to significant time expenditure on inventory management. This diverts valuable time from core business activities, risks stock inaccuracies, and hinders overall operational efficiency.

Furthermore, customers of Alta Sigar & Grill are unable to view product availability or place orders remotely, requiring them to physically visit the store or call to inquire about stock. This inconvenience creates a barrier to purchase, potentially leading to lost sales and reduced customer satisfaction due to a lack of immediate information and accessibility.

Finally, new customers to cigars often feel overwhelmed by the extensive product selection and lack of guidance encountered on other websites when considering a purchase. This intimidation can deter potential new customers from engaging with the hobby. The Alta Sigar & Grill website aims to address this by providing a guided and simplified experience, making their choice easier and fostering a welcoming entry point into the world of cigars.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

1.  **Product Catalog Display:**
    *   **Description:** Up-to-date listings for the "Cigars and Accessories" category, showcasing product name, description, price, and real-time stock quantity. This will also include "Land of origin" and "Vitola" on product pages, with simple, relatable language for taste/flavor to aid newcomers.
    *   **Why essential:** This is the foundational element for the online presence, directly addressing customer visibility of products and stock, and the business owner's need to display inventory.
2.  **Click-and-Collect Ordering System:**
    *   **Description:** A complete system enabling customers to digitally place orders for in-store payment and pickup. This encompasses a functional shopping cart, a checkout page for essential customer details (email, optional phone), and an order confirmation page providing a reference number. Orders will be automatically emailed to the store and recorded in the admin dashboard. The system will feature automatic shopping cart updates and a 30-minute product reservation upon adding to cart, as discussed in brainstorming.
    *   **Why essential:** This is the core transaction mechanism, solving the customer's remote ordering needs and providing the business owner with a critical order management tool.
3.  **Admin Interface for Product & Order Management:**
    *   **Description:** A straightforward dashboard empowering the business owner to manage incoming orders (view, mark as "Processed" or "Completed," delete) and maintain inventory (add, edit, archive products, update stock levels).
    *   **Why essential:** Directly addresses the business owner's primary pain point of lacking an efficient inventory and order management system, significantly boosting operational efficiency.
4.  **Map Functionality:**
    *   **Description:** An integrated Google Maps view on the landing page, clearly displaying the store's location to facilitate customer visits.
    *   **Why essential:** Crucial for driving traffic to the physical store, aligning with a key business objective.

### Out of Scope for MVP

1.  **Full Online Payment and Shipping:**
    *   **Why out of scope:** Introduces substantial complexity (payment gateway integration, shipping logistics, security) that is not critical for validating the initial click-and-collect model. The `proposal.md` explicitly states payment occurs physically at pickup.
2.  **Advanced Search and Filtering for Products:**
    *   **Why out of scope:** While beneficial, a basic product catalog for a single category can effectively serve the MVP's purpose without advanced search/filtering. This can be a future enhancement.
3.  **Customer Accounts or Loyalty Features:**
    *   **Why out of scope:** Adds significant user management complexity (authentication, data storage, privacy) that is not essential for the initial launch.
4.  **Multiple Product Categories (e.g., Barbeques and Accessories):**
    *   **Why out of scope:** The `proposal.md` clearly specifies "one category: Cigars and Accessories" for the MVP. Expanding categories can be a rapid follow-up once the core system is established and proven.

### MVP Success Criteria

1.  **Functional Core:** The website accurately displays inventory and stock levels for "Cigars and Accessories," and the click-and-collect ordering system is fully operational, successfully sending orders to the store's email and saving them in the admin dashboard.
2.  **Business Owner Efficiency:** The business owner can effectively manage products and orders through the admin interface, leading to a measurable reduction in time spent on these tasks as per our objectives.
3.  **Customer Adoption:** Customers can successfully browse products, place click-and-collect orders, and easily locate the store via the integrated map. Newcomers can find suitable products with ease, indicating the effectiveness of our guidance features.
4.  **Technical Stability:** The website is hosted securely, is fully responsive across various devices, and maintains high uptime, ensuring a reliable user experience.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

*   **Target Platforms:** The design must be fully responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across mobile, tablet, and PC devices.
*   **Browser/OS Support:** The application should support standard modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on their latest stable versions. No specific operating system support beyond general web compatibility is explicitly required.
*   **Performance Needs:** The website is expected to be fast and highly responsive, delivering a smooth user experience, particularly during product browsing and the order placement process.
*   **Accessibility Standards:** While not explicitly stated in the proposal, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a recommended best practice for broad accessibility.

### Technology Preferences

*   **Frontend:** Next.js for the framework, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI.
*   **Database:** Supabase.
*   **Hosting:** Vercel.
*   **Maps API:** Google Maps JavaScript API.

### Architecture Considerations

*   **Frontend (Next.js):** Leveraging Next.js will provide benefits such as Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG), which are advantageous for performance and SEO, particularly for a product catalog. Tailwind CSS will be used for a utility-first approach to styling.
*   **Backend (Python/FastAPI):** FastAPI, a modern and asynchronous Python web framework, is well-suited for building efficient APIs required for product management, order processing, and inventory updates.
*   **Database (Supabase):** As a PostgreSQL-based open-source alternative to Firebase, Supabase offers real-time capabilities and integrated authentication, which can be highly beneficial for the admin dashboard and potentially for real-time stock display.
*   **Hosting (Vercel):** Vercel is optimized for Next.js deployments, providing continuous deployment capabilities and scalability.
*   **Maps API (Google Maps JavaScript API):** This is a standard and robust choice for integrating interactive map functionalities.
*   **Security:** The website must be hosted securely over HTTPS. The backend is required to support authenticated admin login.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

1.  **Timeline:** A strict 6-week development timeline, as outlined in the `proposal.md`, significantly influences feature prioritization and overall project complexity.
2.  **Budget/Resources:** Given the context of a solo entrepreneur and the tight timeline, there are inherent budget and resource limitations. The solution must be cost-effective and manageable within these confines.
3.  **Team Size/Expertise:** The project is being developed for a solo entrepreneur, implying a small development team (potentially a single developer or a small agency). This directly impacts the feasible complexity and development velocity of the solution.
4.  **Scope (MVP Focus):** The deliberate focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a defined set of "must-have" features acts as a constraint, necessitating the deferral of other desirable functionalities.
5.  **Payment Method:** A hard constraint is that payment is explicitly "made physically at pickup and is not included in the scope of the website." This directly impacts the design of the ordering system.
6.  **Product Categories:** The MVP is strictly limited to "one main product category (Cigars and Accessories)."

### Key Assumptions

1.  **Technical Feasibility:** We assume that the chosen technology stack (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Python, FastAPI, Supabase, Vercel, Google Maps API) is fully capable of delivering all MVP features within the specified timeline and resource constraints.
2.  **Business Owner's Technical Aptitude:** We assume the business owner possesses sufficient technical aptitude to effectively learn and utilize the admin interface for managing products and orders.
3.  **Customer Adoption:** We assume that target customers will be willing and able to use the click-and-collect ordering system and will find the online product catalog valuable.
4.  **Market Demand:** We assume there is adequate market demand within the Alta region for online product browsing and click-and-collect services for cigars and accessories.
5.  **Data Availability:** We assume that all necessary product data (images, descriptions, prices, initial stock levels) will be readily provided by the business owner to populate the website.
6.  **Google Maps API Usage:** We assume that the Google Maps JavaScript API can be integrated for the "Visit Us" feature without incurring significant costs or encountering major technical hurdles.
7.  **Internet Connectivity:** We assume both the business owner and customers will have reliable internet connectivity to access and effectively use the website.
