## Key Insights and Ideas Generated:

### From Role Playing & Mind Mapping:

*   **Homepage:** Positive first impressions, easy navigation, interesting images, well-organized.
*   **Product Page:**
    *   **Must-Have Information:** Product image, Name, Price, Stock Quantity.
    *   **New Requirement:** "Land of origin" and "Vitola" (cigar shape) should be displayed directly on the product page.
    *   **Usability Improvement:** Add "+" and "-" icons on the product page for direct cart quantity adjustment.
*   **Product Details Page:**
    *   **Desired Information:** Larger image, Land of origin, Taste and flavor, Tobacco leaf type, Recommended use.
    *   **Removed:** Temperature and humidity (from product detail page) - _User request after initial discussion_.
*   **Shopping Cart Icon:** Should update automatically upon adding items, without navigating away from the current page.
*   **Shopping Cart Page:**
    *   **Expected Features:** Complete order list, adjustable quantities (+/-), individual product prices, total price.
    *   **Actions:** Adjust quantities, delete products (trashcan icon), continue shopping, proceed to checkout.
*   **Checkout Page:**
    *   **Required Information:** Full Name (first and last name), E-mail, Phone Number (optional).
    *   **Process:** "Send Order" button enabled after validation, no online payment required.
    *   **Navigation:** Option to return to products page without sending the order.
*   **Confirmation Page:**
    *   **Key Information:** Confirmation that the order has been sent, "Thank you for your order" message, and a clear statement that a new confirmation will be sent when the order is ready for pick-up.
    *   **Action:** "OK" button to return to the products page.

### From Five Whys & Action Planning:

*   **Identified Problem:** Shopping cart does not update automatically, especially when stock is limited or with concurrent orders.
*   **Root Cause (via Five Whys):** Adding a product to the cart does not directly update the stock levels, leading to potential inaccuracies with simultaneous orders.
*   **Proposed Solution (via Action Planning):** When a customer adds a product to their cart, the product should be reserved for 30 minutes, and stock levels should be updated accordingly.

## Session Reflection:

*   **User Feedback:** "The brainstorming session improves our awareness concerning our project, and helps us to uncover potential problems that we initially did not foresee."
